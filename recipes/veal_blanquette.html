        This is a mouthwatering tender roast with vegetables and a great gravy that gives a fantastic presentation for a dinner party, or for a family New Year's Eve dinner. It slow cooks once browned, so you can be straightening up the house while it simmers. You can get the boneless shoulder roast and roll it very tightly yourself and tie it several times with butcher string. Sometimes if you explain to the butcher, they will do it for you. Great served with fresh steamed asparagus or green bean spears.
